# What is ReactJS and how does it works?

ReactJS is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is now open-sourced for public use. ReactJS follows the component-based architecture where UI is broken down into individual components, each with its own state and properties.

ReactJS works by creating a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) in memory, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. Whenever a change is made to the UI, React updates the virtual DOM first, and then efficiently applies the changes to the actual DOM, reducing the amount of time spent updating the browser and improving performance.

ReactJS also supports server-side rendering, allowing for faster initial loading times and improved SEO. Additionally, ReactJS has a large and supportive community, with many open-source libraries and tools available for use.
